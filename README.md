# Analysis of magnetic characterisation tests of electrical steels

Analysis through the application of design of experiments (DOE) in magnetic characterisation tests. The main goal was to analyse the influence of 4 factors (test device, steel class, cutting direction and frequency) in the measurements of total magnetic losses and magnetic permeability of electrical steels.
